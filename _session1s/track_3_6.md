## 개요

Networks for AI getting traction with workloads evolving for deep learning. Today’s AI networks needs high performance and needs all cloud related properties. On network side, the latest SDN revolution is centered on creating efficient virtualized data center networks using RDMA, VXLAN & EVPN. We will talk about AI network at the scale, performance, and cost advantages of using a modern controller-free virtualized network solution built on 100 Gigabit Ethernet switches with hardware based VXLAN Routing. We will explore the ease of automating such a network in an OpenStack environment and take you through a real world use case of using OpenStack Network Node bridging between a bare metal cloud (EVPN) and a fully virtualized cloud environments (orchestrated by Neutron).
